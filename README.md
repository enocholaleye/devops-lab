#  **DevOps Labs** 

Welcome to **DevOps-labs** — my hands-on learning space where I build, break, and improve my DevOps skills from scratch to professional expertise. This repo tracks my career growth as I dive deep into tools, methodologies, and real-world projects, evolving from a beginner to an expert in DevOps engineering.

Every project in this repository is part of my **"Zero to Hero" DevOps journey**. Here, I experiment with various DevOps technologies, including:

- **Linux Administration & Scripting**  
- **Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure)**  
- **Containers & Orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)**  
- **CI/CD Pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)**  
- **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)**  
- **Automation & Monitoring**  
- **Security & Compliance**  
- **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)**

>  _“This is where I get my hands dirty, experimenting and learning by building real-world DevOps solutions.”_
